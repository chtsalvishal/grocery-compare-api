# GroceryCompare Backend API

A FastAPI backend that scrapes weekly specials from Australian supermarkets (Woolworths, Coles, Aldi) and exposes a REST API consumed by the GroceryCompare Android app.

---

## What it does

- Scrapes weekly/half-price specials from Woolworths, Coles, and Aldi
- Normalises products into a unified schema with per-store prices and "was" prices
- Fuzzy-merges the same product across stores (e.g. "Coca-Cola 1.25L" from Coles and Woolworths becomes one record with both prices)
- Runs a full sync automatically every day at 06:00 UTC (4 PM AEST)
- Exposes a REST API for the Android app to fetch and display price comparisons

### Supported retailers

| Store | Source | Method |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Woolworths | `/shop/specials/half-price/*` (12 categories) | ScrapingBee JS scenario (bypasses Akamai WAF) |
| Coles | `/on-special` category pages | Direct HTTP + BeautifulSoup |
| Aldi | `/products/lower-prices` + `/products/super-savers` | Direct HTTP + BeautifulSoup |

### Product categories

Products are classified into: `Produce`, `Meat`, `Dairy`, `Bakery`, `Snacks`, `Beverages`, `Pantry`, `Frozen`, `Personal Care`, `Household`, `Weekly Specials`

    "lastUpdated": "2026-03-20T06:00:00"

---

### `POST /api/sync`
Triggers an immediate full sync of all three stores. Returns the sync result.

```json
{
  "total": 1243,
  "lastSyncedAt": "2026-03-20T06:00:00",
  "stores": [
    { "store": "Woolworths", "status": "ok", "productsFound": 412 },
    { "store": "Coles",      "status": "ok", "productsFound": 526 },
    { "store": "Aldi",       "status": "ok", "productsFound": 305 }
  ]
}
```

---

### `GET /api/sync/status`
Returns the result of the last completed sync. Returns `404` if no sync has run yet.

## Architecture

```
main.py              — FastAPI app, scheduler, sync orchestration
database.py          — SQLite via SQLAlchemy, upsert + fuzzy merge logic
models.py            — Pydantic response models
scrapers/
  coles.py           — Coles scraper (direct HTTP)
  woolworths.py      — Woolworths scraper (ScrapingBee JS scenario)
  aldi.py            — Aldi scraper (direct HTTP)
render.yaml          — Render deployment config
```

### Sync pipeline

1. **Parallel scrape** — all 3 stores scraped concurrently (`ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3)`). Woolworths fetches its 12 categories concurrently too (`max_workers=4`).
2. **Serial DB writes** — SQLite is single-writer; results are written store-by-store after all scraping is done.
3. **Cross-store merge** — `merge_products()` uses `difflib` 80% similarity matching to merge the same product across stores into one record with prices from all matching stores.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY` | Yes (for Woolworths) | ScrapingBee API key. Woolworths uses Akamai bot detection; ScrapingBee runs a real Chrome browser to bypass it. Without this key, Woolworths scraping is skipped. |
| `PORT` | Set by Render | Port to bind on. Defaults to `8000` locally. |

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/) API key (free tier: 1,000 credits/month ~ 16 syncs)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/chtsalvishal/grocery-compare-api.git
cd grocery-compare-api

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your ScrapingBee key
export SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY=your_key_here   # macOS/Linux
$env:SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY="your_key_here"  # Windows PowerShell

# Run the server
python main.py
# or
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8000`. On startup it immediately kicks off a background sync.

### Test the API

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# Get all specials
curl http://localhost:8000/api/specials

# Filter by store and category
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/specials?store=woolies&category=Weekly%20Specials"

# Search by name, sort by savings
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/specials?q=coca-cola&sort=savings"

# Trigger a manual sync
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/sync

# Check last sync status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/sync/status
```

## Deployment (Render)

The repo includes a `render.yaml` for one-click deploy to [Render](https://render.com).

### Steps

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Render, create a new **Web Service** and connect the GitHub repo — or use **Blueprint** to auto-deploy from `render.yaml`.
3. Add the environment variable:
   - Key: `SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY`
   - Value: your ScrapingBee API key
4. Deploy. Render will run `pip install -r requirements.txt` then start with:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```
5. After deploy, the server binds immediately and starts a background sync. The first sync takes 3–5 minutes (ScrapingBee JS scenarios take ~13 seconds per Woolworths category).

### Automatic daily sync

The scheduler runs a full sync every day at **06:00 UTC** (4 PM AEST), after supermarkets post their new weekly catalogues.

To force a re-sync at any time: `POST /api/sync` or tap **Sync** in the Android app.

## ScrapingBee credits usage

| Store | Credits per sync |
|-------|-----------------|
| Woolworths | 60 (5 credits × 12 categories) |
| Coles | 0 (direct HTTP) |
| Aldi | 0 (direct HTTP) |
| **Total** | **~60 credits/sync** |

Free tier: 1,000 credits/month = ~16 full syncs/month.

---

## Database

SQLite file: `specials.db` (created automatically on first run).

Schema (`products` table):

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `name` | TEXT (PK) | Product name (primary key — used for deduplication) |
| `category` | TEXT | Product category |
| `coles_price` | REAL | Current Coles price |
| `woolies_price` | REAL | Current Woolworths price |
| `aldi_price` | REAL | Current Aldi price |
| `coles_was_price` | REAL | Previous Coles price (before special) |
| `woolies_was_price` | REAL | Previous Woolworths price |
| `aldi_was_price` | REAL | Previous Aldi price |
| `unit` | TEXT | Pack size (e.g. `500g`, `1.25L`, `ea`) |
| `image_url` | TEXT | Product image URL |
| `last_updated` | TEXT | ISO timestamp of last update |

Before each sync, the target store's price column is set to `NULL` so stale products that no longer appear in specials are cleared automatically.
